    <h3>About athletes and lakes</h3>
    <h4>Athletes</h4>
    <pre>
An "all-round athlete" is a person who competes in multiple sports at a high level.
Examples of people who played more than one sport professionally include Jim Thorpe, Lionel Conacher, Deion Sanders, Danny Ainge, Babe Zaharias and Erin Phillips.
Others include Ricky Williams, Bo Jackson and Damon Allen, each of whom was drafted both by Major League Baseball and by professional gridiron football leagues such as the NFL and the CFL.
Another female example is Heather Moyse, a multiple Winter Olympic gold medalist in bobsled and member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame who also represented Canada internationally in track cycling and competed at university level in basketball and track and field.
Japanese athletes such as Kazushi Sakuraba, Kazuyuki Fujita, Masakatsu Funaki and Naoya Ogawa have successfully performed in professional wrestling and competed in mixed martial arts.</pre>
    <h4>Lakes</h4>
    <pre>
A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, and set apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake.
Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they do form part of the Earth's water cycle.
Lakes are distinct from lagoons, which are generally coastal parts of the ocean.
Lakes are typically larger and deeper than ponds, which also lie on land, though there are no official or scientific definitions.
Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which usually flow in a channel on land.
Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.
Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation.
Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened into a basin.
Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.
All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.
Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, for aesthetic or recreational purposes, or for other activities.</pre>>
